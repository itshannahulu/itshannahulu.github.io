## About me

I’m Han (Hannah) Guo, an MSc student in Quantitative Finance at the University of California, San Diego (expected December 2025). I work with Prof. Graham Elliott (Economics, UCSD) on quantitative models for electricity markets, with a focus on storage, renewable integration, and revenue adequacy in decarbonizing power systems.

My research sits at the intersection of energy economics, market design, and optimization. I’m interested in how market rules and regulation shape investment in batteries and other flexible resources, and how risk and uncertainty should be reflected in operational decisions. Methodologically, I use econometrics, stochastic optimization, and machine learning, mostly with large-scale hourly ISO data.

Before UCSD, I completed a BSc in Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, where I worked on projects in stellar flares and atmospheric modeling. This background in physical sciences and quantitative modeling informs how I think about uncertainty and dynamics in energy systems today.

## Research interests

- Electricity markets and grid decarbonization  
- Market design for storage and flexible resources  
- Market regulation and “last-mile” integration of renewables and storage (interconnection, telemetry, aggregation rules, performance crediting, data transparency)  
- Revenue adequacy and renewable integration  
- Empirical energy economics: reduced-form and structural work with ISO data, regulatory dockets, and engineering-constrained market models

## Current projects

**Decomposing the Levelized Revenue of Electricity (LROE)**  
Using CAISO hourly generator data to decompose plant revenues into components driven by prices, quantities, and their covariances. I study how increasing renewable penetration and storage affect revenue volatility, market-value erosion, and cross-technology interactions.

**Battery scheduling under price and forecast uncertainty**  
Developing a risk-aware day-ahead scheduling framework for grid-scale batteries. I model 24-hour charge–discharge decisions as an optimization problem that trades off expected revenue against variance and operational constraints, using both statistical and machine-learning price forecasts.

**Spatially optimized forage cultivation in alpine grasslands**  
Coauthoring a paper that combines ecological data, remote sensing, and multi-criteria optimization to identify forage cultivation zones that reconcile livestock production with wildlife conservation on the Tibetan Plateau.

## Looking ahead

I am preparing PhD applications for Fall 2026 entry in economics, public policy, and management science & engineering, with a focus on power systems, market design, and the clean energy transition. I’m excited about work that connects rigorous quantitative modeling with practical questions of how to design electricity markets that support deep decarbonization.
